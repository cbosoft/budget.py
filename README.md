# budget

A very simple costs management and plotting tool.  I wrote this as I was
approaching a change in my financial circumstances I wanted to better
understand. I found it quite handy, despite being so simple, to have a
projection of my bank balance over time. Using this, I could look at different
scenarios to better estimate affordability.

`budget` seeks to build upon this; being able to test multiple tracks into the
future to plan out when a big purchase is feasible, or perhaps to asses efficacy
of different savings accounts, ISAs or stock options.
