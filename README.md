# budget
A very simple costs management and plotting tool.  I wrote this as I was approaching a change in my financial circumstances I wanted to better understand. I found it quite handy, despite being so simple, to have a projection of my bank balance over time. Using this, I could look at different scenarios to better estimate affordability.

# Example
A demo of the library is shown [here](demo.py), results below:
